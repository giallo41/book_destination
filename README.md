# Data Science Task 

## Goal 
Identify users that will eventually book a trip to an advertised destination


### 1. Data pre-Processing 

[1] Dropping NaN data in 'date_from' and 'date_to'<br>

    - relatively small compare to original data size 
    - 'book' event won't work without a 'date_from' and 'date_to'. This data is wrong some way 

[2] Drop duplicated of iata_code in 'iata.csv', because iata_code is not unique<br>
